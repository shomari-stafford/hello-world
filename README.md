My name's Shomari. I'm a digital media and computer theory student. Right now, my biggest interests are AI, AR, and game design. I'm not completely new to programming but I'm missing a lot of the fundamentals (and a portfolio to boot) so, here I am.

Pineapple pizza is good and if you don't agree, we can't hang.
